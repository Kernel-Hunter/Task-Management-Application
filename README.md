# Task Management Application  
A simple and efficient task-management system built using **Stacks and Queues**.  
This project demonstrates core data-structures concepts through task organization, completion tracking, reordering, and statistics.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✔️ Task Addition  
Add new tasks directly to the **queue**, representing the order they should be completed in.

### ✔️ Task Completion  
Mark tasks as completed — they move from the **queue** to a **stack**, allowing users to review completed tasks later.

### ✔️ Reordering Tasks  
Reorder tasks by removing and reinserting them at custom positions in the queue to prioritize work.

### ✔️ Task Statistics  
View useful statistics:
- Number of pending tasks  
- Number of completed tasks  
- Additional relevant metrics  

### ✔️ Undo Feature  
Revert the most recent action (e.g., undo accidental task completion).

### ✔️ Task Categories  
Support for multiple categories such as:
- Work  
- Personal  
- Shopping  
Each category uses its own **stack and queue**.

### ✔️ Recursion Integration  
A recursive method is integrated into one of the features (ex: searching, counting, reversing, etc.).
